# Socket.IO Chess Clock

A simple chess clock using the [socket.io](http://socket.io/) real-time bidirectional event library for Node.js.

Multiple users can join a chess clock by each entering the same room ID when the website loads.

Remixed from [Sotcketio-chat](https://glitch.com/~socketio-chat) with some inspiration/theft from [stopwatch](https://glitch.com/~stopwatch)
